# React Slider

For this week, we'll be putting your React skills to the test, you'll be building a Slider using React!.

## Requirements:

1. There should be a textbox where the user can put links to for images.

2. There should be a button to add the current link on the textbox to the slider.

  * When the button is clicked, the image should be added to the slider.
  
  * The textbox should be emptied after each button click.
  
  * If no text is present in the textbox, the button should be disabled

3. There should be a slider that loads images based off the urls the user provides.

  * The slider should have buttons to move forwards and backwards across the pictures.

  * The slider should show thumbnails of the pictures below it.
  
  * If the user clicks on any of the thumbnails, the slider should jump to that picture.

4. The application should be deployed to heroku https://hackernoon.com/properly-deploy-your-react-app-to-heroku-c1a13f5f978c 

## Hints
